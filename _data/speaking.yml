    This talk from QCon SF is a step-by-step, live-coding class on how to write automated tests for infrastructure
    code, including the code you write for use with tools such as Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, and Packer. Topics
    covered include unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, test parallelism, retries, error handling, static
    analysis, and more.

    My talk from QCon London where I shared key lessons from the "Infrastructure Cookbook" we developed at Gruntwork
    while creating and maintaining a library of over 300,000 lines of infrastructure code used in production by
    hundreds of companies. Topics include how to design infrastructure APIs, automated tests for infrastructure code,
    patterns for reuse and composition, refactoring, namespacing, and more.
