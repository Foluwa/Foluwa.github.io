    This book is the "Hello, World" tutorial for building products, technologies, and teams in a startup environment. I
    based it off of my own experiences, as well as interviews with programmers from some of the most successful
    startups of the last decade, including Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, Stripe, Instagram, AdMob,
    Pinterest, and many others. If you're at all interested in startups, this book is for you.
