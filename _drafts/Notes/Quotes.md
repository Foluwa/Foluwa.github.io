Hello everyone,

I just changed my OS from Windows 10 to parrot OS (Debian). But after using my PC for a while my RAM becomes full and the computer hangs, so I read that I need to create SWAP memory on my hard drive, I followed a blog post post to create it but the swap memory keeps saying 0b

Then I ran "sudo swapon /swapfile" command to enable the swap file

But I keep getting this error

swapon failed:  Invalid argument

You went to school 

Spent 4 years reading

Came out with a 2-1

Waited a few months

Began NYSC orientation camp

Jogged. Ran. Marched.

Served as a teacher in a public school.

A year's almost over.

It's time to job hunt.

You are told to construct a CV

It features when you had your SSCE

And when you bagged your first degree.

Period.

It's empty sheets from then on.

You joined no groups in school.

Competed in no sports.

Volunteered for nothing

Didn't work in any NGO

Lead no initiatives. 

Started no businesses

Just a flat, asystolic life

Clean. Cold. Pulseless. Dead.

Then you say they didn't pick you for the job because there's too much competition.

That's right. You knew that before you graduated judging by how many people were in your final ‚Ä¶

In the latest of its kind phishing attacks, phishers have been found to use custom 404 Not Found error pages to run phishing campaign. This unusual phishing campaign is basically aimed at tricking unsuspecting victims into sharing their Microsoft login credentials.

Interestingly, the 404 Not Found page can easily be customized to show a custom error page, which in this case happens to be a legitimate looking Microsoft sign-in page.

How does 404 Not Found phishing campaign work?

What attackers basically do is, they register a domain and configure the 404 Not Found page to display ‚Ä¶
