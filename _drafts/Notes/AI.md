Suppose you have cancer and you have to choose between a black box AI surgeon that cannot explain how it works but has a 90% cure rate and a human surgeon with an 80% cure rate. Do you want the AI surgeon to be illegal?



Healthcare is fundamentally about care for humans, from illness to wellbeing. It would be wonderful to see more AI efforts towards supplementing and augmenting our human doctors and nurses so that in the near future, a human surgeon’s success rate is 100% due to AI assistance.

Today’s healthcare is rather sick-care. An important contribution of AI would be preventing diseases or predicting them before one gets sick

"If self-driving cars cut the roughly 40,000 annual U.S.
traffic fatalities in half, the car makers might get not
20,000 thank-you notes, but 20,000 lawsuits” - Russel et al 2015
