These are all open source, just like the OpenVINO™ Toolkit. Caffe is originally from UC Berkeley, 
TensorFlow is from Google Brain, 
MXNet is from Apache Software, 
ONNX is combined effort of Facebook and Microsoft, and Kaldi was originally an individual’s effort. 


Most of these are fairly multi-purpose frameworks, while Kaldi is primarily focused on speech recognition data.
