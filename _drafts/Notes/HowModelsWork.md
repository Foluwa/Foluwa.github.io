 ## Decision Tree. 
    There are fancier models that give more accurate predictions. But decision trees are easy to understand, and they are the basic building block for some of the best models in data science.

### The step of capturing patterns from data is called fitting or training the model. The data used to fit the model is called the training data.

### The columns that are inputted into our model (and later used to make predictions) are called "features."
