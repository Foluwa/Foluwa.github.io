Experiences: Full-stack Web Developer at GlobalMohajer
May 2018 - Present
As an 8 months contract/remote job, I made an out-sourcing platform for a company
based in the Netherlands with full-stack skills (Front-end and Back-end). Global
Mohajer is a platform for Iranians who want to migrate and they are looking for a
good migration lawyer to help them, as they register on the site, they add their
immigration work and receive offers from various lawyers, who act as freelances on
the site. as a remote job, it was a great experience for my working with Mr Zarbakhsh
and my tech stack was React/Redux in the front-end and NodeJs/Express/MongoDB in
the back-end.
Front-End Web Developer at Peeker
Feb 2018 - Apr 2018
Working with Peeker's team and Mr Soroush Saffari was a great and nice experience
for me, I was working there Full-time as a front-end/remote (ReactJs/Redux)
developer to develop a panel for operators and admins.
I worked in Peeker for about 5 months and as we know, failure is a part of every
success and Peeker as a startup failed. Soroush (Lead developer) was in Austria, I was
in Tabriz/Iran, and other team members were in Isfahan/Iran and our teamwork was
very good despite the remote work.
Freelance Front-end/Full-stack web developer
Mar 2013 - Jan 2018
As freelance developers, I & Amirhossein Rahmati had a team called Picapixlab.com.
we were working on our client's projects and other companies contractual projects as
a freelance developer. In the Tabriz city, because of the small tech community and a
handful of technology companies we had to work as a freelance developer instead of
full-time working for a company because there is not a lot of jobs in these fields and
also, developer's salaries are so low in our city, Tabriz.
