- "Artificial intelligence is the new electricity!" - Andrew Ng
- Artificial intelligence is the automation of intellectual tasks normally performed by humans
- John McCarthy, then a young assistant professor at Dartmouth, coined the term artificial intelligence in 1995.
- ML is a subfield of Artificial intelligence that uses algorithms and statistical techniques to perform a task
without the use of any explicit instructions.
- ML algorithms perform well on structured data, (e.g sales predictions, recommendation systems)
- As data increases, the performance of traditional machine learning algorithms tends to plateau and deep learning algorithms tend to significantly outperform other learning strategies.
- DL is a subfield of machine learning it application ranges from detecting tumors, self-driving cars and performing optical character recognition (OCR) 
- Deep learning frameworks
- TensorFlow uses a Define and Run paradigm
- PyTorch uses a more ingenuous Define by Run paradigm

- CUDA is a framework developed by NVIDIA that allows us to use General Purpose
Computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU). It is a widely used framework
written in C++ that allows us to write general-purpose programs that run on GPUs. Almost all deep learning frameworks leverage CUDA to execute instructions on GPUs.

-  The original idea of a neural network
was inspired by biological neurons that are found in the human brain, but, at the time of
writing, the similarities between them are only superficial and any comparisons between
the two systems may lead to incorrect assumptions about either of these systems. So, we
won't ponder the similarities between the two systems and, instead, directly dive into the
anatomy of the neural networks that are used in AI.

-A Neural network is an algorithm that learns about the relationship between the input variables and their associated target variables.


- Operations in a neural network are built from two underlying computations. One is a dot
product between the weight vector and their corresponding input variable vector, while the
other is a function that transforms the product into a non-linear space.  
























The success of machine learning models depends on the available data and compute power - Moronfoluwa akin
 Machine Learning is learning from examples.

 ML takes in data and transforms it into a decision surface.

 Features are parts of a data ( or an object) you should pay attention to.
 The beauty of ML is that it doesn't stop, it improves


naive bayes
Supervised classifications alwas call the fit(train) function.



ML Classification Algorithms

- Probablistic Inference - Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- In SVM, the margin is the distance btw the line and the nearest point of the two classes

- Basically, ngrok takes something available/hosted on your localhost and exposes it to the internet with a temporary public URL (Note: you can get a permanent ngrok URL with their paid service). All this in a secure manner. To proceed further with this hack, youâ€™d need an ngrok (free is fine) account and the authtoken of your account from your dashboard.
