Performance of a scikit-learn model
The generalization performance of a scikit-learn model can be evaluated by:

 a) calling fit to train the model on the training set, predict on the test set to get the predictions, and compute the score by passing the predictions and the true target values to some metric function 
 
 b) calling fit to train the model on the training set, score to compute the score on the test set 
 
 c) calling cross_validate by passing the model, the data and the target
