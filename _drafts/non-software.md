“As long as we remember a person, they're not really gone. Their thoughts, their feelings, their memories, they become a part of us.”

― Justin Cronin, The Twelve


Between these nightmares of pandemics and wars, specially for someone living in the middle east. this song always calms me down and gives me a feeling of warmth and comfort.


Moon River,
Wider than a mile:
I’m crossin’ you in style
Some day.
Old dream maker,
You heart breaker,
Wherever your goin’,
I’m goin’ your way:
Two drifters,
Off to see the world,
There’s such a lot of world
To see.
We’re after the same
Rainbow’s end
Waitin’ round the bend,
My huckleberry friend,
Moon River
and me.



One of the kindest and loveliest people to have ever walked the earth.  🤍


You cannot spell awesoME without ME🤍
