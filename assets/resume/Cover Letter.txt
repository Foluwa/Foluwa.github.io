Dear Hiring Manager,



I would like to express my deep interest in the available position as a Backend Engineer for I2X



As an undergraduate I acquired skills while interning with Hotels.ng and participating in the Andela Learning Communities with writing, building, and deploying softwares, I believe I am a strong candidate for a position at I2X



You specify that you are looking for someone with web development data and debugging skills. As a Computer Science major at Osun State University, I have become a skilled developer with a variety of software experience.



My practical experience, attention to detail, and eagerness and passion for innovation made me an excellent software developer. I am confident that I would be a beneficial addition to I2X


Thank you so much for your time and consideration.



Sincerely,



Akintola Moronfoluwa
