I would select developers from Osogbo as my team members to help with organization and publicity and appoint them in roles like publicity, logistics, event planning etc.

Then, I will leverage hashtags while engaging influencers ,and figure out ways to encourage people to share the event's hashtag on social media profiles for example creating a competition in which people can compete for a reward like posting content with the hashtag and giving swags to the winners this will encourage publicity of my first meetup.


I work with the event planning team to locate a conducive venue for the event considering the travel costs and convenience of potential registrants and that venue's capacity, additional rooms, and facilities.


I will set up a call for proposals using tools like sessionize and reach out to prolific developers within my region to handle a workshop or demo during the event, while I and my core team members to help go through speakers proposals that have been received and decide those that would be accepted or rejected.

Then I would finalize on a date most comfortable with people as the event day and set up a show of interest form to estimate the number of people coming for the event.


Finally, on the day of the event, I will do a last-minute preparation before my group meets. I will call the venue to confirm, and also make sure that all the equipment (projectors, microphones, speakers) we would need are on the ground. 


On completion of the event, I will interact with our attendees to find out what will keep bringing them back to future events, and will also come up with more ideas that would involve participation among our community members, for example assigning tasks and roles to community members to give them a sense of responsibility.

I will also stay connected with the community members via the group chats(WhatsApp) and social media pages and groups(facebook and twitter) by starting conversations or creating interesting questions via the communication platforms and also encourage the member to tweet about their progress to stir up the interest of other members.
