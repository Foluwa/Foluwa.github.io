# What is AI at the Edge?
- Edge means local ( or near local) processing, Edge applications ar ofthen used where low latency is necessary and where network connection is not always available also where there is a need for real-time decision making.

- Since edge means no sending of data to the cloud your application could be more secure at the same time having less impact on your network.

- Edge does not mean no cloud usuage, the cloud could still be used for training of AI models and inference is then performed at the edge.Edge AI algorithms can still be trained in the cloud, but get run at the edge.

- ### Consider how mobile maps applications work with network with out mobile devices.

# Why should we use AI at the edge? (Why is AI at the Edge Important?)

- Network impacts                                                                                                                                    Network communication can be expensive (bandwidth, power consumption, etc.) and sometimes impossible (think remote locations or during         natural disasters)

- Latency consideration
          Real-time processing is necessary for applications, like self-driving cars, that can't handle latency in making important decisions

- Security Concerns
        Edge applications could be using personal data (like health or financial data) that could be sensitive if sent to cloud

- Optimization for local inference
        Optimization software, especially made for specific hardware, can help achieve great efficiency with edge AI models
