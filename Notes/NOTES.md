cross origin resource sharing (C0RS)

CORS is necessary when ever the frontend and the backend do not share the same
origin


CORS stands for Cross Origin Resource Sharing. It is a standard that allows us to relax default security rules which prevent HTTP calls from being made between different servers. In our case, we have two origins: localhost:3000 and localhost:4200, and we would like them to be able to communicate with each other.  For this, we need to add some headers to our response object.
