### The Genesis

My name is Moronfoluwa Akintola, a Software Engineer. This is my first post here.

### My Software development story
Life comes at you fast,  Software development was a hobby that turned into a profession. Back in 2011/2012, I had access to my mom's computer and it has Encarta and GTA vice city installed. Each moment I browse the screen, I question myself on how I can build such software. The first time I typed a line of code was sometime in 2013/2014 when the computer studies teacher introduced us to Pascal. Most of what was explained went over my head, but deep down I always knew this is where my passion lies.


### Interests
Currently, I am a Software engineer with a keen interest in Machine learning. My stack includes but not limited to React.js, Flask, Flutter, Express.js and Pytorch. I am a member of Google Developer Students Clubs, AI Saturdays Lagos and Andela Learning Community. Apart from Software, I am a jazz lover. 




### Expectations
This blog would be about Software development and anything I feel is worth penning down. Constructive criticism is welcomed. Feel free to reach out to me.  Stay tuned  ðŸ˜ƒ
