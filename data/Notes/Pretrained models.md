Pretrained models are models models where training has already occurred, and often have high, or even cutting-edge accuracy. Using pre-trained models avoids the need for large-scale data collection and long, costly training. Given knowledge of how to preprocess the inputs and handle the outputs of the network, you can plug these directly into your own app
